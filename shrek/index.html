It was the day after Christmas, and shrek had finished his job.
Love has been given to twelve thousand children the day prior.
"aah" shrek sighed as he reclined in his armchair made from lord farquaad's skin. " I could really do with a treat"
Flying towards the fridge, Shrek realised that his job was not entirely complete. One child remained loveless.
His name was Dylan Cooper.
Shrek wolfed down his onion in one gulp and flew off for the mysterious land of Warrington.
Dylan lay down on his bed that was made entirely out of php. He sobbed as he remembered that shrek had forgotten to give him his love.
Meanwhile, Shrek galloped through Dylan's walls.
"OOOOOAAAARGH!!" Shrek roared as he destroyed Dylans bed with his onion tip.
Dylan suddenly saw his dad, who was drunk of course, who said "mmngh, who the f*** are you?" Shrek, angered by his rudeness, bellowed "THIS IS MY SWAMP NOW!" and spewed pure 100% Tropicana onion juice from his eyes and flooded the room.
Dylan's dad drowned in the juice and instantly rotted to a skeleton. Suddenly, all of the onion juice returned to shrek's onion-sacsâ„¢ as he catapulted through the open gap in the wall.
Dylan wiped the mixture of onion juice and tears from his eyes as he spotted Shrek riding his donkey-drawn sleigh.
